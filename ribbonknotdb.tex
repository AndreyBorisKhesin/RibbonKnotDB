\papersection{Introduction}
A ribbon knot is a knot that contains only ribbon singularities.
A ribbon singularity occurs when the disk that is bounded by the knot only
intersects itself in pairs, e.g. when the boundary of the disk passes through
said disk, there will be another intersection ``nearby'' with the opposite sign.
A ``ribbon presentation'' for a knot depicts the knot as the image of a series
of disks, each connected to the next by an arc, the ribbon, which is ``split''
into two strands after applying the map.

A symmetric union is a knot that is symmetric about a central axis, save the
crossings that lie on the axis itself.
It is well-known that any symmetric union is a ribbon knot.
However, at this time of this writing TODO SOURCE it is not yet known whether
every ribbon knot can be expressed as a symmetric union.
For all 21 knots with 10 or fewer crossings it has been shown that they can be
expressed as symmetric unions TODO SOURCE.

Here we attempt to publish a database of the planar diagram crossing information
of the 21 knots.
They are $6_1$, $8_8$, $8_9$, $8_{20}$, $9_{27}$, $9_{41}$, $9_{46}$, $10_3$,
$10_{22}$, $10_{35}$, $10_{42}$, $10_{48}$, $10_{75}$, $10_{87}$, $10_{99}$,
$10_{123}$, $10_{129}$, $10_{137}$, $10_{140}$, $10_{153}$, and $10_{155}$.
This notation consists of a list of crossings of the form $X_{a,b,c,d}$ which
labels the four strands in a crossing from the lower incoming string and
continues counterclockwise.

\papersection{Tangles}
A tangle is a collection of joined crossings with a certain number of ``loose
ends'' sticking out.
A tangle with $n$ strands will have $2n$ such ends sticking out.
For convenience, a tangle is drawn as a braid, with $n$ ends along the top and
$n$ ends along the bottom where the order of the strands along the top is the
same as along the bottom.
In other words, if one were to follow each strand in a tangle, they would end up
exactly below the point at which they started.
Let the tops of the strands be denoted by $1_t$, $2_t$, ..., $n_t$, and the
bottoms  by $1_b$, $2_b$, ..., $n_b$.

A closure of a tangle is a manner of stitching the ends of the tangle together
to reduce the resulting number of strands.
For a tangle with $2n$ strands, we define the top-closure of the tangle as the
closure that stitches together the pairs $(1_t$, $2_t)$, $(3_t$, $4_t)$, ...,
$((2n-1)_t$, $(2n)_t)$ to create $n$ strands.
For a tangle with $2n$ strands, we define the full-closure of the tangle as the
closure that stitches together the pairs $(1_b$, $2_b)$, $(2_t$, $3_t)$, $(3_b$,
$4_b)$, ..., $((2n-2)_t$, $(2n-1)_t)$, $((2n-1)_b$, $(2n)_b)$ to create 1
strand.

\begin{theorem}
A knot $K$ is ribbon$\iff\exists$ a tangle $T$ with $2n$ strands where the
top-closure of $T$ creates the trivial tangle with $n$ strands, while
full-closure of $T$ creates a tangle with 1 strand, identical to the knot $K$
(obtained by stitching $(1_t$, $(2n)_t)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
($\impliedby$)
If the top closure of a tangle $T$ results in $n$ trivial strands that can be
untangled, that means among the top-closure of $T$, there are only ribbon
singularities, as any clasp singularities would not make the top-closure of $T$
trivial.
We can now consider closing those $n$ strands along the bottom to create $n$
unlinks.
Then each unlink is connected to the next using a single strand.
That strand may pass through the plane of the original knot, but if it were to
be unzipped into strands, it would result in only ribbon singularities.
This has effectively connected every adjacent pair of links as well as the first
and last links together, creating the original knot by our assumption.
Thus, since the resultant knot only contains ribbon singularities, $K$ is
ribbon.
\end{proof}
