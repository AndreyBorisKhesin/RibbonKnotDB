\papersection{Introduction}
A ribbon knot is a knot that contains only ribbon singularities.
A ribbon singularity occurs when the disk that is bounded by the knot only
intersects itself in pairs, e.g. when the boundary of the disk passes through
said disk, there will be another intersection ``nearby'' with the opposite sign.
A ``ribbon presentation'' for a knot depicts the knot as the image of a series
of disks, each connected to the next by an arc, the ribbon, which is ``split''
into two strands after applying the map.

A symmetric union is a knot that is symmetric about a central axis, save the
crossings that lie on the axis itself.
It is well known that any symmetric union is a ribbon knot.
However, at this time of this writing TODO SOURCE it is not yet known whether
every ribbon knot can be expressed as a symmetric union.
For all 21 knots with 10 or fewer crossings it has been shown that they can be
expressed as symmetric unions TODO SOURCE.
\papersection{Tangles}
A tangle is a collection of joined crossings with a certain number of ``loose
ends'' sticking out.
A tangle with $n$ strands will have $2n$ such ends sticking out.
For convenience, a tangle is drawn as a pure braid, with $n$ ends along the top
and $n$ ends along the bottom where the order of the strands along the top is
the same as along the bottom.
In other words, if one were to follow each strand in a tangle, they would end up
exactly below the point at which they started.
Let the tops of the strands be denoted by $1_t,~2_t$, ..., $n_t$, and the
bottoms  by $1_b,~2_b$, ..., $n_b$.

\svg{diagrams/tangle}
\papercaption{In a tangle, the ends do not have to be drawn along the top and
bottom.
This is done for convenience.
In practice, the $2n$ ends could be located anywhere on the perimeter.
Here the central $R$ represents a knot that shows that the strands are tangled,
but link up with their corresponding ends as shown.}

A closure of a tangle is a manner of stitching the ends of the tangle together
to reduce the resulting number of strands.
For a tangle with $2n$ strands, we define the top closure of the tangle as the
closure that stitches together the pairs
$(1_t,~2_t),~(3_t,~4_t),~...,~((2n-1)_t,~(2n)_t)$ to create $n$ strands.

\svg{diagrams/top}

For a tangle with $2n$ strands, we define the full closure of the tangle as the
closure that stitches together the pairs $(1_b,~2_b),~(2_t,~3_t),~(3_b$,
$4_b),~...,~((2n-2)_t,~(2n-1)_t),~((2n-1)_b,~(2n)_b)$ to create 1 strand.

\svg{diagrams/full}

We point out that in both scenarios, one is effectively closing the strands
along the bottom in the same manner.
In the top closure, the strands create an untangle which can be turned into the
unlink by closing the strands along the bottom as it is done in the
full closure.

\begin{papertheorem}{ribbon}
A knot $K$ is ribbon$\iff\exists$ a tangle $T$ with $2n$ strands where the
top closure of $T$ creates the trivial tangle with $n$ strands, while
full closure of $T$ creates a tangle with 1 strand, identical to the knot $K$
(obtained by stitching $(1_t,~(2n)_t)$).
\end{papertheorem}
\begin{proof}
If the top closure of a tangle $T$ results in $n$ trivial strands that can be
untangled, that means among the crossings that make up the top closure of $T$,
there are only ribbon singularities, as any clasp singularities would not make
the top closure of $T$ trivial.
We can now consider closing those $n$ strands along the bottom to create $n$
unknots.
Then each unknot is connected to the next using a single strand.
That strand may pass through the plane of the original knot, but if it were to
be unzipped into strands, it would result in only ribbon singularities.
This has effectively connected every adjacent pair of links as well as the first
and last links together, creating the original knot by our assumption.
Since the resultant knot only contains ribbon singularities, $K$ is ribbon.

Conversely, let us consider a tangle $T$ with $n$ strands and $2n$ ends along
the top numbered $1_t$ to $(2n)_t$.
\begin{paperlemma}{tangles}
If a tangle $T$ with $n$ strands with $2n$ ends along the top can be top closed
(with $n$ stitchings) to create the unlink consisting of $n$ unknots, then
$\exists$ a tangle $T'$ consisting of $2n$ strands with $2n$ ends along the top
and $2n$ ends along the bottom such that applying the stitchings$(1_b,~2_b),~
(2_t,~3_t),~(3_b~4_b),~...,~((2n-2)_t,~(2n-1)_t),~((2n-1)_b,~(2n)_b)$ (just the
bottom part of the full closure) results in $T$.

\svg{diagrams/lemma}

\end{paperlemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma]
Once $T$ is closed, a continuous deformation of three dimensional space turns it
into the unlink.
Here, we extend the $n$ segments from the unlink to points outside the tangle,
making sure that they do not intersect.
This can be done trivially as $T$ is untangled.
If we were to reverse the earlier spatial deformation, we will end up a tangle
with $2n$ ends along both the top and the bottom, where the bottom ends extend
to be stitched pairwise as described earlier and the tangle can be top closed to
produce the untangle.
This tangle is therefore $T'$.
TODO DIAGRAM
\end{proof}
For any knot in its ribbon presentation, we can enclose the lower half of each
component in one large tangle.
The knot can be deformed until the ribbon connects the tops of the knot's
components, making sure the ends of the ribbons are above the upper boundary of
the tangle.

\svg{diagrams/lowered}

It is important to note that everything above the upper boundary of the tangle
is exactly as described while the ribbons inside the tangle can have any number
of crossings.
Since any space that is in the tangle but above the ribbon is connected to the
outside of the knot, any strands that pass through it can be moved up and around
the knot to end up fully inside the tangle.
This means that any ribbon knot with $n$ components can be transformed into a
tangle with $2n$ ends along the top that has been top closed with $n-1$ ribbon
bridges between each of the closing loops.

\svg{diagrams/twisted}

Here the knot in the tangle is completely different and all the crossings are in
the components of the knot, as opposed to the ribbon.
This is equivalent to applying just the top part of the full closure to the
tangle and then applying the closure $(1_t,~(2n)_t)$.

\svg{diagrams/complete}

We note that since any ribbon knot is a series of unzipped strands connecting
subsequent components of the unlink, then the removal of these strands will
result in the unlink.
Similarly, if a ribbon knot were to be deformed in the above manner, then
removing the ribbons would also result in the unlink.
We also note that in any situation, removing a ribbon is equivalent to unzipping
it, cutting both strands of the ribbon, then stitching each strand to the one it
was unzipped from.

\svg{diagrams/cut}

Removing the ribbons from our deformed ribbon knot would therefore be identical
to applying the top closure to its tangle.
This means that the tangle that makes up the bulk of the knot satisfies the
conditions for $T$ in \lemtangles, thus there exists a similar tangle T', that
satisfies the conditions of the tangle we were looking for.
\end{proof}
\papersection{Symmetric Unions}
We now provide a list of all 21 ribbon knots with 10 crossings or fewer.
Each was originally a symmetric union provided by TODO SOURCE and was deformed
to appear as the full closure of a tangle (with the extra stitching of $4_t$ and
$1_t$).
TODO DIAGRAM

The locations of the cuts that result in the ends $1_b$ and $2_b$ as well as
$3_b$ and $4_b$ are, in general, not very interesting.
It is merely a location on the knot that can be kept on the outside while
untangling the top closure of the tangle.
We do note that in the symmetric union, the locations of the two important cuts
can always be obtained by deforming the knot (but preserving its symmetry) until
one of the bridges appears above any crossings on the axis of symmetry.
Then the knot is cut just above this bridge along the first strands that cross
it, moving out from the middle of the bridge.

\papersection{Database}
Here we attempt to publish a database of the planar diagram crossing information
of the 21 knots.
They are $6_1,~8_8,~8_9,~8_{20},~9_{27},~9_{41},~9_{46},~10_3$,
$10_{22},~10_{35},~10_{42},~10_{48},~10_{75},~10_{87},~10_{99}$,
$10_{123},~10_{129},~10_{137},~10_{140},~10_{153}$, and $10_{155}$.
This notation consists of a list of crossings of the form $X_{a,b,c,d}$ which
labels the four strands in a crossing from the lower incoming strand and
continues counterclockwise.

\svg{diagrams/crossing}

The knots are encoded as they appear in TODO FIGURE NUMBER.
The tangle information consists of the list of segments of the knot (before any
stitching between crossings is done) of each strand of the tangle.
A strand in a crossing will carry the number of the knot segment going into it.
Here we present knot $6_1$ as an example.
