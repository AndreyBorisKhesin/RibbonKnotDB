\papersection{Introduction}
A ribbon knot is a knot that contains only ribbon singularities.
A ribbon singularity occurs when the disk that is bounded by the knot only
intersects itself in pairs, e.g. when the boundary of the disk passes through
said disk, there will be another intersection ``nearby'' with the opposite sign.
A ``ribbon presentation'' for a knot depicts the knot as the image of a series
of disks, each connected to the next by an arc, the ribbon, which is ``split''
into two strands after applying the map.

A symmetric union is a knot that is symmetric about a central axis, save the
crossings that lie on the axis itself.
It is well-known that any symmetric union is a ribbon knot.
However, at this time of this writing TODO SOURCE it is not yet known whether
every ribbon knot can be expressed as a symmetric union.
For all 21 knots with 10 or fewer crossings it has been shown that they can be
expressed as symmetric unions TODO SOURCE.
\papersection{Tangles}
A tangle is a collection of joined crossings with a certain number of ``loose
ends'' sticking out.
A tangle with $n$ strands will have $2n$ such ends sticking out.
For convenience, a tangle is drawn as a braid, with $n$ ends along the top and
$n$ ends along the bottom where the order of the strands along the top is the
same as along the bottom.
In other words, if one were to follow each strand in a tangle, they would end up
exactly below the point at which they started.
Let the tops of the strands be denoted by $1_t$, $2_t$, ..., $n_t$, and the
bottoms  by $1_b$, $2_b$, ..., $n_b$.
TODO DIAGRAM

A closure of a tangle is a manner of stitching the ends of the tangle together
to reduce the resulting number of strands.
For a tangle with $2n$ strands, we define the top-closure of the tangle as the
closure that stitches together the pairs $(1_t$, $2_t)$, $(3_t$, $4_t)$, ...,
$((2n-1)_t$, $(2n)_t)$ to create $n$ strands.
For a tangle with $2n$ strands, we define the full-closure of the tangle as the
closure that stitches together the pairs $(1_b$, $2_b)$, $(2_t$, $3_t)$, $(3_b$,
$4_b)$, ..., $((2n-2)_t$, $(2n-1)_t)$, $((2n-1)_b$, $(2n)_b)$ to create 1
strand.

\begin{theorem}
A knot $K$ is ribbon$\iff\exists$ a tangle $T$ with $2n$ strands where the
top-closure of $T$ creates the trivial tangle with $n$ strands, while
full-closure of $T$ creates a tangle with 1 strand, identical to the knot $K$
(obtained by stitching $(1_t$, $(2n)_t)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
$(\impliedby)$
If the top closure of a tangle $T$ results in $n$ trivial strands that can be
untangled, that means among the top-closure of $T$, there are only ribbon
singularities, as any clasp singularities would not make the top-closure of $T$
trivial.
We can now consider closing those $n$ strands along the bottom to create $n$
unlinks.
Then each unlink is connected to the next using a single strand.
That strand may pass through the plane of the original knot, but if it were to
be unzipped into strands, it would result in only ribbon singularities.
This has effectively connected every adjacent pair of links as well as the first
and last links together, creating the original knot by our assumption.
Thus, since the resultant knot only contains ribbon singularities, $K$ is
ribbon.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}
$(\implies)$
TODO PROVE FOR $n>2$
If a knot is ribbon and has only two disks with a single ribbon passing through
them, then to create the tangle, each disk can be cut and the ribbon can be cut.
The top-closure will be result of stitching across the ribbon.
More rigourously, when cutting the ribbon, we are cutting the knot twice, one
cut creates the ends $4_t$ and $1_t$ while the other creates the ends $2_t$ and
$3_t$, in order of appearance when moving along the knot.
Since the ribbon's strands run antiparallel to each other, then $1_t$ is closer
to $2_t$ and vice versa.
The other cuts are placed on the disk for convenience, but the only restriction
on them is that they have to be on the outside of the knot, and there has to be
one on each side of the ribbon cuts.
It is clear that the full-closure will create the original knot $K$, while the
top-closure will connect $1_t$ and $2_t$ as well as $3_t$ and $4_t$ which will
trivially untangle by the properties of the ribbon, creating the trivial tangle
with 2 strands.

\papersection{Symmetric Unions}
We now provide a list of all 21 ribbon knots with 10 crossings or fewer.
Each was originally a symmetric union provided by TODO SOURCE and was deformed
to appear as the full closure of a tangle (with the extra stitching of $4_t$ and
$1_t$).
TODO DIAGRAM

The locations of the cuts that result in the ends $1_b$ and $2_b$ as well as
$3_b$ and $4_b$ are, in general, not very interesting.
It is merely a location on the knot that can be kept on the outside while
untangling the top-closure of the tangle.
We do note that in the symmetric union, the locations of the two important cuts
can always be obtained by deforming the knot (but preserving its symmetry) until
one of the bridges appears above any crossings on the axis of symmetry.
Then the knot is cut just above this bridge along the first strands that cross
it, moving out from the middle of the bridge.

\papersection{Database}
Here we attempt to publish a database of the planar diagram crossing information
of the 21 knots.
They are $6_1$, $8_8$, $8_9$, $8_{20}$, $9_{27}$, $9_{41}$, $9_{46}$, $10_3$,
$10_{22}$, $10_{35}$, $10_{42}$, $10_{48}$, $10_{75}$, $10_{87}$, $10_{99}$,
$10_{123}$, $10_{129}$, $10_{137}$, $10_{140}$, $10_{153}$, and $10_{155}$.
This notation consists of a list of crossings of the form $X_{a,b,c,d}$ which
labels the four strands in a crossing from the lower incoming string and
continues counterclockwise.
TODO DIAGRAM

The knots are encoded as they appear in TODO FIGURE NUMBER.
The tangle information consists of the list of segments of the knot (before any
stitching between crossings is done) of each strand of the tangle.
A strand in a crossing will carry the number of the knot segment coming into it.
Here we present TODO KNOT as an example.

\papersection{A Correction}
We would like to use this opportunity to point out some slight errors in TODO
BOOK TITLE.
In Appendix TODO APPENDIX AND PAGE NUMBER, the ribbon presentations of the knots
TODO LIST KNOTS are incorrect, on account of the Jones polynomial of the
presentations not matching that of the intended knots.
Interestingly, all 4 knots evaluate to have the correct Alexander polynomial.
For this reason, we suspect the mistake was caused by one or more $\Delta\Delta$
moves while deforming the knot into the intended form.
